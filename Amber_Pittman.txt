3 Words That Describe Me: Curious, Tenacious, Ambivert

My favorite hobby is reading. It can be fiction or nonfiction. I read tons of articles each 
week. I read so much, I finally subscribed to Medium. It's been beneficial for sure. I find 
this especially true for tech articles as well as career and financial advice posts.
